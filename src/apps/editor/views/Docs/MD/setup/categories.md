# Categories

Categories help organize your portal's content into logical sections, making it easier for readers to discover and navigate your posts. Think of categories as the main sections of your portal—like "Technology," "News," or "Reviews."

#### Key Features

- **Hierarchical Organization**: Create parent and child categories for detailed content structure
- **Content Filtering**: Readers can browse posts by category on your portal
- **SEO Benefits**: Well-organized categories improve your portal's discoverability
- **Unlimited Categories**: Create as many categories as needed for your content

#### Creating Categories

- **Access Categories**
  - Navigate to **Setup** in the main menu
  - Select the **Categories** section

- **Add a New Category**
  - Click the **Add Category** button

  - Choose a parent category (optional) to create subcategories
  - Click **Save** to create the category

- **Edit Categories**
  - Click on any existing category to edit its name

#### Best Practices

- **Keep It Simple**: Start with 3-7 main categories—you can always add more later
- **Be Descriptive**: Use clear, descriptive names that readers will understand
- **Plan Your Structure**: Think about how your content naturally groups together
