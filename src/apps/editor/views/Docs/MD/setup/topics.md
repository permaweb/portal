# Topics

Topics are tags that help you organize and describe the specific subjects covered in your posts. While categories provide broad organization, topics offer detailed, granular tagging to help readers find exactly what they're looking for.

#### Key Features

- **Flexible Tagging**: Add multiple topics to each post for detailed organization
- **Content Discovery**: Readers can browse posts by topic to find related content
- **Trending Topics**: Track which topics are most popular with your audience
- **Cross-Category Organization**: Topics can span multiple categories

#### Creating Topics

  - Navigate to **Setup** in the main menu
  - Select the **Topics** section

- **Add a New Topic**
  - Click the **Add Topic** button
  - Enter a descriptive topic name

#### Topics vs. Categories

**Categories** are like broad sections of a newspaper:
- Technology
- Sports  
- Politics
- Lifestyle

**Topics** are like specific story tags:
- `artificial-intelligence`, `machine-learning`, `programming`
- `basketball`, `nba-playoffs`, `team-stats`
- `election-2024`, `local-government`, `policy-analysis`
- `healthy-eating`, `fitness-tips`, `mental-health`

#### Best Practices for Topics

- **Be Specific**: Use descriptive, specific terms that readers might search for
- **Use Consistent Naming**: Establish conventions (e.g., `web-development` not `webdev`)
- **Avoid Duplication**: Don't create similar topics (`AI` and `artificial-intelligence`)
- **Think Long-term**: Choose topic names that will remain relevant over time
- **User-Friendly**: Use terms your audience will understand and search for

#### Topic Examples by Portal Type

**Technology Blog:**
- `javascript`, `react`, `node.js`, `web-development`
- `artificial-intelligence`, `machine-learning`, `data-science`
- `cybersecurity`, `blockchain`, `cloud-computing`

**News Portal:**

- `sports-scores`, `game-recap`, `player-trades`

#### Using Topics Effectively

**When Creating Posts:**
- **Add 3-5 Topics**: Enough to be descriptive without overwhelming
- **Mix Broad and Specific**: Include both general and detailed topics
- **Consider Your Audience**: Use terms your readers would search for
- **Be Consistent**: Use the same topic names for related content

**Topic Organization:**
- **Review Regularly**: Remove topics that are no longer relevant
- **Merge Similar Topics**: Combine topics that serve the same purpose
- **Create Topic Groups**: Mentally group related topics for better organization

#### Managing Topics

- **Topic Analytics**: Monitor which topics generate the most reader interest
- **Seasonal Topics**: Create temporary topics for events or seasonal content
- **Topic Cleanup**: Regularly review and remove unused or outdated topics
- **Search Optimization**: Use topics that people commonly search for

#### Advanced Topic Strategies

**Content Series:**
- Use consistent topics for multi-part series (e.g., `beginner-guide-series`)
- Create year-based topics for annual content (e.g., `2024-predictions`)

**Event Coverage:**
- Create specific topics for major events you're covering
- Use hashtag-style topics for trending discussions

**Reader Engagement:**
- Ask readers what topics they want to see more of
- Create polls about which topics interest them most
- Use topic popularity to guide your content strategy

#### Topic Display

Topics appear in several places in your portal:

- **Post Pages**: Listed with each post to show what it covers
- **Topic Archive**: Dedicated pages showing all posts with specific topics
- **Search Results**: Help readers find related content
- **Sidebar Widgets**: Popular topics can be featured in your portal's sidebar

Remember: Good topic management helps readers discover your content and helps you understand what your audience finds most valuable. Think of topics as the keywords that define what each post is really about.
