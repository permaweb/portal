# Post Editor

The portal editor uses a **block-based** approach to content creation, where each block represents a specific type of content (e.g., paragraph, quote, image). By stacking these blocks, you can build a structured post or page with clear organization and a visually coherent layout. This modular design makes it easy to insert, rearrange, and format different sections of your content.

#### Key Components

- **Post Title & Status**

  - At the top, you can set your **Post Title** and toggle between **Draft** or **Published** status.

- **Block Creation & Editing**

  - Each piece of content is a “block.” Examples include **Header**, **Paragraph**, **Quote**, **Lists**, **Image**, and **Video** blocks.
  - You can add a new block by using the **Toolkit** (right panel) or a keyboard shortcut (e.g., `Ctrl + / + P` for Paragraph).

- **Toolkit**

  - On the right, you’ll find the **Toolkit** panel with a list of available blocks and their associated keyboard shortcuts.
  - Use this panel to quickly insert new blocks or to reference shortcuts for faster editing.

- **Layout**
  - Each block can be dragged and dropped to reorder content.
  - Click and hold the handle on the left side of a block to move it up or down in your document.

#### Basic Usage

- **Add a New Block**

  - Select a block type from the **Toolkit** or use a keyboard shortcut (e.g., `Ctrl + P` for Paragraph).
  - A new block appears; type your content or insert media.

- **Apply Headings and Styles**

  - Use **Header** blocks (H1–H6) to structure your content.
  - Use **Paragraph** blocks for regular text and **Quote** blocks for quotations or callouts.

- **Add Media**

  - Insert **Image** blocks to upload or link to images.
  - Insert **Video** blocks to embed video content from supported platforms.

- **Edit or Delete Blocks**

  - Click within a block to edit its text or replace its media.
  - Look for the block’s context menu (often a small icon or “...” button) to see options like **Delete** or **Duplicate**.

- **Rearrange Blocks**

  - Hover over a block to reveal the drag handle on the left.
  - Click and hold the handle to move the block up or down.

- **Save**
  - Once you’re satisfied, click **Save** to store your draft.
  - Toggle the **Draft** status to **Published** when you want the post to go live.
