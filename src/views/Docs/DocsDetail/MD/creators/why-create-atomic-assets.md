## Create atomic assets

Creating atomic assets isn't just about creating digital content; it's about empowering creators to take control of their creative works and create economic value on their own terms. By bringing your content fully onchain, with real-world rights, you're not just showcasing your creativity; you're creating a new internet economy that is owned by the creators and forever preserved on the Arweave network. You can start creating atomic assets with [Helix](https://helix.arweave.net/).

#### Why create atomic assets?

###### Atomic assets are permanent

Your digital creations can live forever on Arweaveâ€™s permaweb. You no longer have to worry about centralized platforms controlling content that users create.

###### Atomic assets are fully onchain

Many NFT marketplaces handle transactions onchain, but the art itself often lives on centralized servers. In this case, you do not truly own the digital content. On Bazar, you will see that the full asset (content and metadata) lives fully onchain in one transaction.

###### You can leave a lasting digital impact

With atomic assets on Arweave, you are essentially creating a digital archive of content that is unique to you. Creating atomic assets allows you to archive your work in a decentralized space, ensuring its longevity and accessibility for future generations.

###### Why the permaweb?

Creating on the permaweb opens the doors to instant sharing and engagement across permaweb platforms. Content is no longer siloed in centralized platforms. Your work becomes discoverable and collectible by people who appreciate and value great content. As the permaweb social sphere widens, your atomic assets will have an even broader reach.

###### Earn on your own terms

Creating on the permaweb provides an opportunity to capture value from your creative endeavors. With the economic freedom offered by atomic assets, creators can monetize their work directly, bypassing traditional intermediaries and unlocking new revenue streams.

Creators can also set the terms for how their content can be used with the Universal Data License (UDL). Creators can upload atomic assets with UDL tags in the metadata, indicating how the media is licensed. This programmable data license gives creators full control over how their atomic assets are accessed and used. Learn more about UDL [here](https://bazar.arweave.net/#/learn/exploring-bazar/universal-data-license).

###### Conclusion

Atomic assets on Arweave are about building a fairer and freer internet where creators own and control their content. By creating with Bazar, you're contributing to a decentralized ecosystem where creators are empowered to monetize their creativity on their own terms, free from the constraints of traditional platforms and advertisers. So, why wait? [Create atomic assets](https://helix.arweave.net/) and join us in shaping the future of digital ownership and expression.
