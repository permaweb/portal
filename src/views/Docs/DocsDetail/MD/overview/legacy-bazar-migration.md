## Legacy Bazar Migration

**To all Legacy Bazar users:** As we transition from Legacy Bazar, we're taking steps to ensure a smooth migration process for all users. This includes transferring PIXL balances and streaks, reimbursing U holders with wAR, and enabling creators to move their atomic assets to AO.

#### wAR for U Airdrop

All U holders will receive an equivalent amount of wAR, airdropped to their Arweave wallets, based on the value of U on [Permaswap](https://www.permaswap.network/).

#### PIXL and Streak Migration

Your PIXL balances and streaks will be seamlessly migrated to AO PIXL. Streaks accumulated on Legacy Bazar up until June 6th will be added to your current streaks on AO Bazar.

#### Asset Migration

Creators can migrate their collections and single atomic assets to AO Bazar. You'll find a "Migrate to AO" button on your profile page, available for both individual assets and collections.

###### Please note:

- **Only assets under 10MB can be migrated to AO**. We're working on a solution to support larger file uploads and will share updates as soon as possible.
- **Only the original creators of atomic assets can migrate them to AO**. If you own an asset and wish to migrate it, you'll need to contact the creator to initiate the process.

#### What’s Next?

We sincerely appreciate the continued support from the Arweave and AO communities as we navigate this transition. Migrating to AO provides us with the best opportunity to create a fully decentralized, stable, and scalable platform to support the growing permaweb.

That said, Bazar remains a work in progress. We’re still experimenting with new features and iterating based on community feedback. Additionally, AO infrastructure, which Bazar operates on, is still in the testnet phase. This means there may be bugs and changes, but we are fully committed to creating the best permaweb experience possible.

Thank you for being part of this journey.
