## Profiles

Your permaweb profile is an AO process which is owned by your Arweave wallet. This process carries out interactions with the UCM and holds custody to your atomic assets.

### How to create a profile

###### 1. Connect your Arweave wallet

When you enter Bazar, the first step is to connect your Arweave wallet. This wallet holds your unique address on the Arweave network. If you do not have an Arweave wallet, you can create one with [Arconnect](https://www.arconnect.io/) or [Othent](https://othent.io/).

###### 2. Create your profile

After connecting your wallet, you create a permaweb profile. This profile is an unique AO process that you can customize with a name, @handle, profile picture, and header. **Profile and header images must be under 100kb**. As more permaweb applications adopt AO profile specs, this profile will be interoperable across the permaweb. Learn more about the permaweb [here](https://ao-bazar.arweave.net/#/docs/key-concepts/permaweb).

### Transfer assets from your wallet to your profile

Profiles on Bazar have a different ID than your Arweave wallet address. This means assets need to be sent to your Profile ID, not your Arweave wallet address. If an asset is in your wallet but not showing in your profile, you can transfer it back to your profile connected to that wallet with these steps:

1. Log in to Bazar with your profile.
2. Navigate to the asset's page.
3. Select the "Transfer" tab.
4. Choose the maximum "Asset quantity" and paste your Profile ID into the "Recipient" field.
5. Complete the transfer to return the asset to your profile.
