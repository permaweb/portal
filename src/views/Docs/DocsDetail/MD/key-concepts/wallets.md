## Arweave wallets

An Arweave wallet is your passport to the permaweb. A wallet is needed to create a Bazar profile and to create or collect atomic assets. Wallets can be generated with the [ArConnect](https://www.arconnect.io/) browser plugin or with a Google login using [Othent](https://othent.io/).

#### How do Arweave wallets work?

- **Public and private keys**: Arweave wallets are based on a cryptographic key pair system. Each wallet has a private key and a public key. The public key is your wallet address, which you can share with others to receive funds or transact atomic assets. The private key is used to sign transactions and must be kept secure.
- **Secure transactions**: When you perform a transaction, such as uploading data to the permaweb or sending AR tokens, your wallet uses your private key to sign the transaction, ensuring authenticity and integrity.
- **Permanent data storage**: All transactions are stored permanently on Arweave. The [Viewblock](https://viewblock.io/arweave) block explorer allows you to discover and view the status of Arweave transactions. To find your transfer, you can search for your wallet address or the ID of your transfer in the search bar at the top of the site.

#### Wallet security

- **Private key security**: The security of your Arweave wallet heavily relies on the security of your private key. If someone gains access to your private key, they can control your wallet and its contents. It is crucial to store your private key in a secure location and never share it with anyone. **Keep multiple copies of your wallet key file and seed phrase in secure locations.**
- **Decentralized**: Arweaveâ€™s decentralized nature means there is no central authority that can access or control your wallet. This decentralization enhances security by removing single points of failure. In other words, if you lose your wallet key file, no one can help you access your wallet.
- **dApp permissions**: When using the ArConnect wallet plugin, you can determine how your wallet interacts with permaweb applications. This gives you control over what information the app can access and how it can interact with your wallet. This is accessed within the ArConnect plugin by clicking on the three dots on the right, then selecting settings, and applications. There you can see your settings for each connected application.
