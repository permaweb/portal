## Bazar & UCM explained

Bazar is the first digital content marketplace built on the Universal Content Marketplace (UCM) protocol. The Universal Content Marketplace (UCM) is a revolutionary protocol built on the permaweb, specifically designed to enable trustless exchange of atomic assets. It empowers creators and users alike to interact, trade, and transact with any form of digital content, from images and music to videos, papers, components, and even applications.

## Why we use UCM?

UCM provides a secure and transparent environment to trade assets without relying on third parties. It ensures data permanence on Arweave, eliminating the fear of losing valuable content.

With UCM, creators retain control control over their assets. UCM fosters a decentralized ecosystem where creators can interact, trade, and collaborate with confidence, knowing their data and ownership are protected.

UCM isn't limited to a single asset type or use case. It's a versatile protocol that accommodates a wide range of digital assets. From artwork to music, research papers to digital components, UCM enables seamless trading of diverse assets, driving innovation and creativity.
