## How to fund your account

The Wrapped AR (wAR) token is the currency used on Bazar. This guide will walk you through how to purchase AR and bridge it to AO as wAR for use on Bazar and other permaweb applications.

#### Bridge AR onto AO (AR → wAR)

If you hold AR, you can bridge it onto AO using [AOX](https://aox.arweave.net/#/). The bridged funds will be sent to your Arweave wallet and be accessible from your Bazar profile.

#### wAR Depot: Swap USDC/ETH for wAR

You can swap USDC or ETH for wAR by using the [Wrapped AR Depot](https://wardepot.arweave.net/). Here’s how:

1. Sign in with your Ethereum wallet.
2. Input amount of USDC or ETH to swap.
3. Input the receiving Arweave wallet.
4. Confirm swap and sign transactions.

###### **Note: You must sign 3 transactions to complete this process. It will take about 30 minutes for funds to arrive in your wallet.**

#### Purchase AR tokens via ArConnect

ArConnect released an easy to use process to purchase AR tokens directly in the Arconnect wallet with [Transak](https://transak.com/). This process is the simplest but may require you to complete KYC (Know Your Customer) steps depending on your location and the amount of AR tokens you want to buy.

1. Open your ArConnect wallet.
2. Click the “Buy AR” button on the ArConnect dashboard.
3. Enter the amount of AR tokens you want to purchase, the currency you’ll use for payment, and your payment method.
4. Follow any additional steps in Transak’s interface to complete the transaction.

###### **Note: This process may require you to complete KYC (Know Your Customer) steps depending on your location and the amount of AR tokens you want to buy.**

#### Purchase AR tokens with on-ramp services

On-ramp services offer another simple way to purchase AR tokens. Most services accept multiple currencies and allow purchases with debit/credit cards, wire transfers, or other local payment methods. On-ramp services that support AR tokens include:
